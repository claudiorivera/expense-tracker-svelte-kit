# expense-tracker-svelte-kit

This is my version of the Expense Tracker from Traversy Media's YouTube course, remade from scratch using SvelteKit and made to be deployed on Vercel.

## Prerequisites

In order to develop locally, you'll need the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli)

## Install

`yarn`

## Config

Add a `.env.local` file that includes a `MONGODB_URI` value.

## Develop

`vercel dev`
